## About

If you've been at the local gym, you know there are countless number of exercises, both cardio and weight training, that focus on different parts of the body. What if you wanted to know about a specific workout, like the name, which muscles are targeted and how to correctly do it?

I developed Fitness-VQA, a multimodal multilingual (English and ‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶Ç‡¶≤‡¶æ) dataset that enables seamless multi-turn conversations for visual question answering about fitness workouts.

FitLensAI is a Llama 3.2 Vision 11B vision-language model (VLM) trained using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning on Fitness-VQA. FitLensAI generates tailored responses to questions about fitness workout images in English and ‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶Ç‡¶≤‡¶æ, and enables dynamic multi-turn conversations.

The methodology and technical details of its creation will be added later.

## Features

### FitLensAI can generate specialized responses for fitness workouts

<img src="media/seated_cable_row.png" width="500px" />

| Question | Llama 3.2 Vision Reponse | FitLensAI Response |
|----------|------------------|--------------|
| What is the name of the workout? | The seated row is a compound exercise that targets the latissimus dorsi, trapezius, rhomboids, and biceps muscles. It is an effective exercise for building strength and size in the back, and can be performed with or without a barbell. | Seated Cable Row |
| Which body part is the focus of the workout? | The seated row is a compound exercise that targets the latissimus dorsi, trapezius, rhomboids, and biceps muscles. It is an effective exercise for building strength and size in the back, and can be performed with or without a barbell. | Latissimus Dorsi, Rear Deltoids, Rhomboids, Biceps |
| How do I do this exercise step by step from the image? | Here are the steps to do a seated row exercise: 1)Sit on the rowing machine with your feet flat on the floor or on the footrests, depending on the machine. 2) Grasp the bar with an overhand grip, with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. 3) Lean back slightly and keep your back straight, engaging your core muscles to maintain good posture. 4) Pull the bar towards your chest, keeping your elbows close to your body and your biceps engaged. 5) Squeeze your shoulder blades together and pull the bar towards your chest, then slowly return to the starting position. 6) Repeat for the desired number of repetitions. Remember to focus on proper form and technique to get the most out of the exercise and avoid injury. | Sit on seated cable row machine with legs extended. Grip attachment with hands slightly wider than shoulders. Pull attachment to lower chest, focusing on pulling movement with upper back and lats. Avoid using momentum and swinging. Touch chest lightly with attachment, then push body forward slightly to return attachment to starting position. Maintain upright posture throughout movement. |

Existing MLLMs like Llama 3.2 are not capable of generating specialized responses. This is because MLLMs are generalist models that can perform wide range of tasks, think jack of all trades. The example above shows that while Llama 3.2 is able to understand the question, the output is not precise and quite often irrelevant, leading to information overload! In contrast, FitLensAI gives precise, concise and context-appropriate answers.

### FitLensAI is designed for multilingual conversations

Current MLLMs primarily focus on English and few other major languages, limiting practical applications in multilingual settings. Some examples include VLMs like Pixtral, Qwen-VL and more recently Llama 3.2 Vision. In the example, Llama 3.2 generates incorrect sentences and keywords that are entirely out of context. FitLensAI performs somewhat better, as it produces responses that are more relevant. While it fails to generate accurate long sequences in detail, the words are related to fitness workouts.

### Limitations

The model fails when tasked with describing workouts in ‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶Ç‡¶≤‡¶æ, especially when required to generate long and coherent sequences of text. While Fitness-VQA includes question-answer pairs in ‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶Ç‡¶≤‡¶æ, the dataset is insufficient for the model to learn and generate accurate, context-appropriate and detailed responses in the language. It struggles to understand and capture the nuances of ‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶Ç‡¶≤‡¶æ, resulting in incomplete or irrelevant outputs. Future work will aim at incorporating diverse and extensive multilingual training data to enhance the model's ability to handle such tasks effectively and expand its applicability real-world multilingual scenarios.

### Takeaways

This project demonstrates that we can carefully design datasets such that a single model can have multimodal, multilingual and multi-turn conversational capabilities. All this, without relying on other models, for example machine translation models to translate from one language to another.

### Todos

* More data to make it work for long sequences in ‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶Ç‡¶≤‡¶æ
* Train Pixtral 12B
